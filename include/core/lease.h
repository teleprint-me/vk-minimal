 * @brief A dynamic runtime allocator for tracking memory address states.
 *
 * Each object assumes full ownership of its internal components.
 *
 * Structure:
 * - A LeasePolicy defines the access and ownership rules for a memory region.
 * - A LeaseObject represents the allocated address, size, and alignment.
 * - A LeaseTenant combines a Policy with an Object to form a complete allocation contract.
 *
 * Ownership Model:
 * - A LeaseObject owns its address unless specified otherwise by its LeasePolicy.
 * - A LeaseTenant owns both its LeasePolicy and LeaseObject.
 * - Each LeaseTenant must be freed exactly once.
 * - Policies and Objects must not be shared across multiple Tenants.
 * - All internal structures are heap-allocated to prevent stack exhaustion at scale.
 *
 * This design enables clear, deterministic ownership semantics in C,
 * with explicit control over lifetime and tracking of dynamic memory.
